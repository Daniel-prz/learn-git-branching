Completing these exercises built upon the git knowledge learned earlier. It was pretty informing in effective use of git branch, git rebase, and cherry-pick
for rearranging and re-ordering commits and branches.

## day-4

Step 1: Create a Feature Branch (Local):
Step 2: Simulate Main Branch Updates (Local and Remote):
![GitHub 'main' commit](<Screenshot 2024-02-22 212621.png>)
local:
made feature-branch branch  
made changes
back to main
made different changes
committed main changes
make remote changes to directly to GitHub and commit

![Local Rebase](<Screenshot 2024-02-22 213451.png>)
Local:
switched back to feature-branch
stash previous changes
use git rebase main
successful rebase
![Stashed Changes commit](<Screenshot 2024-02-22 214142.png>)
use git stash pop to make stashed changes
commit stashed changes

![GitHub 'main' commit 2](<Screenshot 2024-02-22 214852.png>)
make local changes to main and commit
make remote changes to main directly on GitHub and commit
![Local Pull + Merge ](<Screenshot 2024-02-22 215128.png>)
use git pull to merge commits

Exercises were able to reinforce what I've learned in a more practical way
and see how these commands play out in a more realistic setting
